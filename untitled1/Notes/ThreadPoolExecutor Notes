TPE:
creating a thread on demand may create memory and performance problems.
hence use TPE.
Java 1.5 onwards, threadPool framework was introduced to implement thread pools.
TP Framework is also known as Executor Framework.

Create a TP:
    ExecutorService ex = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(3);
We can submit a runnable job using:
    ex.submit(job);

We can shutdown ExecutorService by:
    ex.shutdown();
